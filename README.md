# ModalWavefrontReconstruction
This is a repository for modal wavefront reconstruction method

The code is based the paper "Modal wave-front estimation from phase derivative measurements" - Ronald Cubalchini, 1979 (https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSA.69.000972) 

The measurement surface(wavefront) is made with combination of random Zernike polynomials (1st to 15th orders)

Reconstruction Accuracy Metrics
PV - Peak to Valley
RMS - Root Mean Square
